# Automating Invoice Processing with Python and Power Automate

As a System Analyst, I constantly look for ways to streamline processes and improve efficiency. One of the biggest challenges we face is handling a large volume of supplier invoices.

## Problem Statement

We receive a large number of invoices from suppliers, which need to be verified against stock purchase orders in our inventory. This process is:

üîπ Currently, our team loads invoices, cross-checking the invoiced stock against the received stock in our inventory system.

üîπ This process involves opening each invoice, searching for the corresponding purchase order, and validating the details.

üîπ It's time-consuming, repetitive, and prone to human errors, leading to inefficiencies and potential mismatches.

## To solve this, I designed an automated invoice processing system. This system:

‚úÖ Extracts invoice details from PDFs using OCR

‚úÖ Matches invoices with purchase orders from inventory

‚úÖ Formats the data for accounting systems like Xero

‚úÖ Renames invoices using actual invoice numbers

## The Solution

Leveraging my programming, and accounting skills, I analyzed the entire process and developed an automation system that significantly reduces manual effort.


## How It Works

‚úÖ Step 1: Automating Invoice Collection ‚Äì A Power Automate Flow downloads all incoming invoice PDFs from emails into a designated folder.

‚úÖ Step 2: Extracting Key Information ‚Äì A Python script scans each invoice, extracting critical details like Invoice Number, PO Number, Invoice Date, and Total Amount using OCR and Regex.

‚úÖ Step 3: Matching with Inventory ‚Äì The script cross-references invoices with our inventory records, ensuring that the billed stock aligns with received stock.

‚úÖ Step 4: Formatting for Xero ‚Äì The extracted data is structured into a CSV file compatible with Xero, making it easy to import and process invoices.

‚úÖ Step 5: Organizing Files ‚Äì The script renames invoice PDFs using actual invoice numbers, improving file management.


## 1. Downloading Invoices from Email (Power Automate Flow)

A Power Automate Flow automatically downloads all incoming invoice PDFs and saves them in a designated folder

## 2Ô∏è. Extracting Invoice Data (Python & PDF Parsing)

The Python script scans all PDF invoices in the folder and extracts key details using regex patterns:

- Invoice Number

- Purchase Order (PO) Number

- Invoice Date

- Subtotal Amount

# Automating Invoice Processing with Python and Power Automate

As a System Analyst, I constantly look for ways to streamline processes and improve efficiency. One of the biggest challenges we face is handling a large volume of supplier invoices.

## Problem Statement

We receive a large number of invoices from suppliers, which need to be verified against stock purchase orders in our inventory. This process is:

üîπ Currently, our team loads invoices, cross-checking the invoiced stock against the received stock in our inventory system.

üîπ This process involves opening each invoice, searching for the corresponding purchase order, and validating the details.

üîπ It's time-consuming, repetitive, and prone to human errors, leading to inefficiencies and potential mismatches.

## To solve this, I designed an automated invoice processing system. This system:

‚úÖ Extracts invoice details from PDFs using OCR

‚úÖ Matches invoices with purchase orders from inventory

‚úÖ Formats the data for accounting systems like Xero

‚úÖ Renames invoices using actual invoice numbers

## The Solution

Leveraging my programming, and accounting skills, I analyzed the entire process and developed an automation system that significantly reduces manual effort.


## How It Works

‚úÖ Step 1: Automating Invoice Collection ‚Äì A Power Automate Flow downloads all incoming invoice PDFs from emails into a designated folder.

‚úÖ Step 2: Extracting Key Information ‚Äì A Python script scans each invoice, extracting critical details like Invoice Number, PO Number, Invoice Date, and Total Amount using OCR and Regex.

‚úÖ Step 3: Matching with Inventory ‚Äì The script cross-references invoices with our inventory records, ensuring that the billed stock aligns with received stock.

‚úÖ Step 4: Formatting for Xero ‚Äì The extracted data is structured into a CSV file compatible with Xero, making it easy to import and process invoices.

‚úÖ Step 5: Organizing Files ‚Äì The script renames invoice PDFs using actual invoice numbers, improving file management.


## 1. Downloading Invoices from Email (Power Automate Flow)

A Power Automate Flow automatically downloads all incoming invoice PDFs and saves them in a designated folder

## 2Ô∏è. Extracting Invoice Data (Python & PDF Parsing)

The Python script scans all PDF invoices in the folder and extracts key details using regex patterns:

- Invoice Number

- Purchase Order (PO) Number

- Invoice Date

- Subtotal Amount

## Key Technologies Used:

pdfplumber ‚Üí Extracts text from PDFs

re (Regex) ‚Üí Identifies invoice details

pandas ‚Üí Stores extracted data in a structured format


## 3Ô∏è. Matching Invoices with Inventory Data

The extracted invoice details are cross-referenced with a CSV file containing inventory records. This ensures that: 

‚úÖ The invoice corresponds to a valid purchase order 

‚úÖ The correct warehouse location is identified


## 4Ô∏è. Formatting Data for Xero Accounting System

To simplify invoice entry into Xero, the script generates a structured CSV file in Xero‚Äôs required format. The output includes:

- Supplier Name

- Invoice Number

- Invoice Date

- Due Date

- Description

- Quantity

- Unit Price

- Tax Type

- Warehouse Location

## Key Process:

- The script maps warehouse codes (AKL, WLG, CHC) to full location names (Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch).

- The final CSV file is saved as {supplier}_to_xero.csv, ready for import into Xero.

## 5Ô∏è. Renaming Invoices with Actual Invoice Numbers

To keep files organized, the script renames each invoice PDF based on the extracted invoice number.

Example: üìÑ randomfile.pdf ‚Üí üè∑Ô∏è 123456 - PO-78910.pdf


## Key Benefits of This Automation

- Eliminates manual data entry ‚Äì Reducing human effort and freeing up valuable time.

- Enhances accuracy ‚Äì Minimizing errors in stock reconciliation.

- Improves efficiency ‚Äì Speeding up invoice processing and purchase order verification.

- Better file organization ‚Äì Making invoices easy to track and retrieve.


## Invoice Processing Automation for Supplier PDFs

This project automates the extraction and transformation of key data from supplier invoice PDFs to streamline accounting workflows. The goal is to generate a CSV file ready for direct upload into Xero accounting software.

### Process Overview
For each invoice PDF, the script automatically extracts the following fields:

- Tax Invoice Number

- Invoice Date

- Order Number ‚Äì A 5-digit number in the invoice, automatically prefixed with "PO-" to match the format used in our inventory system (e.g., PO-12345).

- Total Excluding GST

### Refactored Version
Here‚Äôs a cleaned-up and modular version of the script

#### Key Improvements:
- Modular structure: Each part of the workflow is encapsulated in a function.
- Robustness: Added error handling and logging.
- Scalability: Easier to add new features (like new fields or formats).
- Readability: Organized flow from config to execution.
- Clean CSV and file renaming logic.

## Final Output

After processing all invoice PDFs, the script compiles the extracted and formatted data into a standardized CSV file that aligns with Xero's import requirements. This eliminates manual data entry, reduces errors, and ensures seamless integration with existing inventory and accounting systems.

# Project Conclusion
### Overview
This project automates the extraction, validation, and formatting of invoice data from PDF files and cross-references them with inventory records. By using Python, PDF parsing (pdfplumber), regular expressions, and pandas, it streamlines a previously manual and error-prone process into a fully automated workflow.

### Business Impact
Time Savings : Previously, staff spent 2 to 3 minutes per invoice reading, checking POs, and entering data into accounting software. Now, hundreds of invoices can be processed in seconds with a single script execution.

Reduced Errors : Ensures only valid purchase orders are processed, reducing the risk of incorrect stock reordering or accounting mismatches.

Regex validation: Eliminates inconsistencies from human error (typos, missing fields, date mismatches).

Improved Data Consistency : Uses a uniform format for all invoices going into the accounting system.

Clear PDF naming improves file organization.

# Automating Invoice Processing with Python and Power Automate

As a System Analyst, I constantly look for ways to streamline processes and improve efficiency. One of the biggest challenges we face is handling a large volume of supplier invoices.

## Problem Statement

We receive a large number of invoices from suppliers, which need to be verified against stock purchase orders in our inventory. This process is:

ðŸ”¹ Currently, our team loads invoices, cross-checking the invoiced stock against the received stock in our inventory system.

ðŸ”¹ This process involves opening each invoice, searching for the corresponding purchase order, and validating the details.

ðŸ”¹ It's time-consuming, repetitive, and prone to human errors, leading to inefficiencies and potential mismatches.

## To solve this, I designed an automated invoice processing system. This system:

âœ… Extracts invoice details from PDFs using OCR

âœ… Matches invoices with purchase orders from inventory

âœ… Formats the data for accounting systems like Xero

âœ… Renames invoices using actual invoice numbers

## The Solution

Leveraging my programming, and accounting skills, I analyzed the entire process and developed an automation system that significantly reduces manual effort.

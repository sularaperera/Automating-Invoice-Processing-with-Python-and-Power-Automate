# Automating Invoice Processing with Python and Power Automate

As a System Analyst, I constantly look for ways to streamline processes and improve efficiency. One of the biggest challenges we face is handling a large volume of supplier invoices.

## Problem Statement

We receive a large number of invoices from suppliers, which need to be verified against stock purchase orders in our inventory. This process is:

ðŸ”¹ Currently, our team loads invoices, cross-checking the invoiced stock against the received stock in our inventory system.

ðŸ”¹ This process involves opening each invoice, searching for the corresponding purchase order, and validating the details.

ðŸ”¹ It's time-consuming, repetitive, and prone to human errors, leading to inefficiencies and potential mismatches.
